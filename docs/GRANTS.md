# 🔬 ICS v4.0 — SCIENTIFIC GRANT & RESEARCH PROPOSAL
## RJ Business Solutions | Independent Research

### 🎓 Research Problem
As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale, the quadratic cost of self-attention window expansion creates a "context ceiling." Current RAG systems are often shallow and lack hierarchical depth, leading to loss of "long-range dependencies" in complex reasoning tasks.

### 🧪 Our Solution: Recursive Neural Compression
ICS v4.0 implements a novel **Recursive Hierarchical Summarization** algorithm. By distilling historical context into multi-level summaries while maintaining a high-fidelity vector retrieval backup, we enable agents to maintain a "global state" without the computational overhead of massive context windows.

### 📊 Methodology & Verification
- **Dataset**: Testing against LongBench and ZeroSCROLLS benchmarks.
- **Metrics**: Measuring Context Precision, Context Recall, and Faithfulness.
- **Auditability**: Complete transparency in memory storage and retrieval paths.

### 🌍 Social Impact
Democratizing access to "infinite context" by making it computationally efficient for small-scale enterprises and independent researchers.
