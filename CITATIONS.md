## 1. Core Theoretical Foundations
The recursive summarization and hierarchical memory models in ICS are influenced by the following research:

1.  **"Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection"** (Asai et al., 2024).
    *   *Application*: Used in Tier 3's reflection loops for source verification.
2.  **"Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite Context Transformers with Infini-attention"** (Munkhdalai et al., 2024).
    *   *Application*: Conceptual basis for Tier 1's dynamic context window management.
3.  **"GraphRAG: Unlocking LLM Discovery on Narrative Private Data"** (Edge et al., 2024).
    *   *Application*: Implementation architecture for Tier 4's Neo4j entity mapping.

## 2. Technical Libraries & Tooling
ICS stands on the shoulders of the following industry-leading open-source projects:

-   **Qdrant Vector Database**: High-performance vector search engine.
-   **Neo4j Graph Database**: Native graph storage for entity persistence.
-   **Redis**: Distributed caching and session synchronization.
-   **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance web framework.
-   **Pydantic v2**: Strict data validation and type safety.
-   **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: State-of-the-art NLP models.

## 3. Acknowledgements
- **RJ Business Solutions**: Principal funding and project vision.
- **DeepMind & OpenAI Research**: Continuous advancement in context-window architectures.
